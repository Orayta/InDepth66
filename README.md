# InDepth365
This is a mobile phone project to provide an In-Depth Christian Bible study application for both iPhone and Android users. The goal is to provide a short daily devotional that is more teaching focused than spiritual nourishment focused. Not to say that normal devotionals don't teach the reader, but they tend to rely heavily on personal life experiences of the authors to explain a biblical principal and help the user feel connected with God. This apps focus will be to provide the reader with a short, informative, and sequential devotional on every chapter of The Bible.

The motivation for this app came from the nourishment and teaching recived from the departed Dr. J. Vernon McGee. To go ahead and give him credit the user can assume most of the devotional teachings are from his ThruTheBible ministry. I only depart in cetain areas of the text, but will provide his opinion so the reader can make their own choice. I think differences are a welcome teaching tool and Like Dr. McGee frequently says, (paraphrased) "I can fellowship with anyone, provided we meet around the person of Christ."

The projects intent is two fold. First, make Dr. McGees's teachings more easily accessible for reading (hopefully in multiple languages). Second, go into further depth in those areas that Dr. McGee had to pass over in order to meet his 5 year timeline.  

Getting the gospel of Jesus Christ out is of the utmost urgency so a new release will push everytime a book of The Bible is completed. It'll take a while so be still. In the end InDepth66 will offer a daily study from Aleph to Tav of God's beautiful word!

Dear Lord, please bless this project in the precious name of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
