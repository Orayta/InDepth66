Genesis 1:1 - In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

For many years the scientific community has grappled with theories on the creation and evolution of the universe. Since the 1960s the leading foundation of these theories links to a singular phenomenon that occurred 13.8 billion years ago called the Big Bang. Contrary to popular belief, the Big Bang is not an explosion like a bomb going off and pushing matter out in all directions. It is more of an expansion of space itself. It's not an explosion into space but an explosion of space, and the universe is still expanding today. You may believe in this theory or you may not. Your position is irrelevant to the overwhelming evidence in support of this fact. At some point in the distant past, the universe erupted into existence and the force of that event is visible today. So, what about the timeline or the age of creation? Don't be so quick to break out your calculators and mark time from the birth of Seth to the death of Jesus. You'll land on an answer between 4,000-11,000 years depending on a few theological hurdles. In any case, you'll gloat over your mathematical prowess and still be wrong. We will have the opportunity to speak to the age of creation in later devotionals, but God's word supports that this universe is far older than you think. That doesn't debunk God's word but adds to the splendor and greatness of it and His majesty!

What are Christians supposed to do with these theories? Should we dig in and have another Copernicus fight, claim that our Bible doesn't say Big Bang, so it must be a lie? We may set ourselves up for a fall. The truth is that there is ample, real evidence to support that some elements of the theories are correct. Is that in conflict with God's word? Did you know there are at least 11 verses in the old testament testifying that God stretches out the heavens? Isaiah 45:12 makes it clear that the reference is not to the sky but space. Does that sound like an expansion to you? We better be familiar with God's word before we use it to argue against science. Unfortunately, the average Bible literacy of the believing Christian today is somewhere on the scale near a toddler. The Church at large is incapable of making logical connections between the Biblical account and the evidence we observe. Issac Newton once said, “When I wrote my treatise about our system, I had an eye upon such principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity, and nothing can rejoice me more than to find it useful for that purpose.” Newton's investigation of the universe, coupled with his desire to understand who created it, grew his faith. Our approach to science should be like our approach to a Sunday sermon. We should hold everything up to the light of the word of God, rightly dividing the truth. We are not called to argue science, our command is to declare God to the world. If we get bogged down in the details of how it happened, we will miss the opportunity to glorify who did it. No amount of data in the world is going to answer who created all this. Nothing observed it, nothing recorded it, and that is because God created it from nothing. 

Genesis 1:1 is the first thing God says to us because He doesn't want us to doubt what He did. He wants us to look out on the beauty, splendor, and magnificence of creation and stand awestruck at how wonderful He is. Creation is God's hello message to humanity, and He wants us to take it on faith. Most people don't care to know Him, so they focus their attention on how it came about and not who did it. This means that mankind has two choices, believe in revelation or settle for speculation. There is not a third option to bridge the gap. No scientific theory on creation can bridge the gap between nothing and something, between something and life, and between life and humanity. 

The pursuit of knowledge is a gift from God, but it is rather presumptuous to pretend we know more than we do. We can accept these majestic words of God with faith and find satisfaction with that. You don't have to know how He did it, you don't have to know when He did it. No one does, no one ever will in this life. If you needed to know, He would have told you, but He didn't. There are 31,102 verses in the Bible and God only talks about creation in 304 of them. His emphasis is not on creation but on knowing Him. 

He wants us to declare with the Psalmist, Paul, and the writer of Hebrews. "When I consider Your heavens, the work of your fingers, the heavens declare the glory of God" (Psalm 8:3). "For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see His invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature. So, they have no excuse for not knowing God” (Romans 1:20).  "By faith we understand that the entire universe was formed at God’s command, that what we now see did not come from anything that can be seen" (Hebrews 11:3).

You must accept Genesis 1:1 by faith. To reject it is to reject God, reject revelation, deny the deity of Christ, deny the fall and redemption of man, deny the fact of sin, rob God of the honor and glory He deserves, and my friends, you're robbing yourself of the honor and glory God wants to shower on you through His son Christ Jesus. 

One should ask why He did it. This is the most important thing to see. This universe that you and I live in today is for His pleasure. He saw fit to create it and delighted in it. His word says, “You are worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory and honor and power. For you created all things, and they exist because you created what you pleased” (Revelation 4:11) He created this universe because He wanted to create it. He did it for **HIS** pleasure. You may not like it, but He does. 

The second reason He created the universe was for His glory. Job 38 tells us that the original creation sang out to the glory of God and the angels shouted for joy with it. Isaiah says, “Bring all who claim me as their God, for I have made them for my glory. It was I who created them” (Isaiah 43:7).
Finally, God created this universe and man in it for fellowship. He placed the first man in the Garden of Eden and God sought him out for fellowship with him. He made Adam a free moral agent. He could have made man mechanical, but He wanted a man that was free to choose, love, and serve Him. That was the awful blasphemy that Satan hurled against Job, "Does Job fear God for nothing?" (Job 1:9). In other words, Satan is saying, “God, you are paying Job for his affection.” God wanted us to choose him for ourselves and that is the greatest thing you can do as a human being. Even in the middle of this unbelief and blasphemy around us; for us to say, "I choose Jesus, I accept and receive Him, I believe in God the Father, all-mighty maker of heaven and earth." That is the most glorious privilege that you and I have. It will unlock the key to every chain that holds us down today. Man doesn’t know what real freedom is. Freedom only comes by choosing Jesus Christ as your savior.
